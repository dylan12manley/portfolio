            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Before starting at Epicodus, I had a very limited knowledge of coding. The only coding experience I had was self taught, online courses, through codeacademy. Codeacademy was super helpful in instilling confidence in me. I have had three good friends finish Epicodus and get good jobs over the past three years, so I've been trying to build the confidence to start and codeacademy was integeral in that.</p>
            <p>I have been cooking and serving in restaurants for the past ten years. On my free time I have been playing and producing music. I was taking it seriously for a couple of years, putting together shows, building a community and tried to run a small recording studio, but alas, the way I was going about it was unsustainable. Now music is just a hobbie and I'm looking to advance my career in the tech industry.</p>
